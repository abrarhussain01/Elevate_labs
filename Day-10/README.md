# Employee Department SQL Views

This project demonstrates how to use **SQL JOINs and VIEWS** to simplify querying employee and department data for reporting and analytics.

## Tables Used
- `employees` – stores employee details like name, salary, and department ID  
- `departments` – stores department name and location  

## View Created
`employee_department_view` combines employee and department data using an INNER JOIN.

## Key Operations
- Create a complex JOIN query
- Convert JOIN into a SQL VIEW
- Query, filter, and sort data from the VIEW
- Understand VIEW security and read-only limitations
- Use VIEWs for reporting and dashboards
