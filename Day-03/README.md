📌 Overview

    This task focuses on filtering data from a database table using SQL conditional clauses. The goal is to retrieve precise records based on different conditions such as age, name patterns, email domains, and        NULL values.

🛠 Tools Used

    MySQL Workbench

    SQL (Structured Query Language)

📂 Table Structure

    The table used for this task is students with the following columns:

    id – Student ID

    name – Student Name

    age – Student Age

✨ Concepts Covered

    WHERE clause for filtering records

    AND / OR for multiple conditions

    LIKE with wildcards (%, _)

    IN for multiple values

    BETWEEN for range filtering

    IS NULL for handling NULL values

    Column aliases using AS

🧪 Queries Implemented

    Filter students by specific age

    Retrieve records using multiple conditions

    Search names using pattern matching

    Filter emails based on domain

    Fetch records within an age range

    Handle NULL values safely

    Improve readability using aliases

✅ Final Outcome

    By completing this task, I gained hands-on experience in advanced SQL filtering techniques and learned how to extract accurate data efficiently based on real-world conditions.
