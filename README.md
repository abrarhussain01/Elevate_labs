During my internship training, I worked on hands-on MySQL database tasks to strengthen my understanding of relational database concepts and SQL operations. The training focused on building a strong foundation in database design, data manipulation, and query execution.

I practiced creating databases and tables, inserting and managing records, and executing SQL queries to verify and analyze data. These tasks helped me understand how databases are structured and how data is efficiently stored, retrieved, and maintained in real-world applications.

This internship training improved my practical knowledge of MySQL, enhanced my problem-solving skills, and prepared me to work with databases in backend development and software projects.
