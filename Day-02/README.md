This repository contains the solution for Task 2 of the SQL Developer Internship assignment. The task focuses on understanding SQL data types, constraints, and basic table modification commands using MySQL.

Task Description:
A STUDENTS table is created using SQL with the following constraints:

ID is defined as a PRIMARY KEY to uniquely identify each record.

NAME and AGE are marked as NOT NULL to ensure mandatory data.

EMAIL is marked as UNIQUE to prevent duplicate email entries.

Sample data insertion is performed to demonstrate constraint validation, including an intentional PRIMARY KEY violation to observe database error handling.

The task also includes table modification operations such as:

Adding a new column

Renaming an existing column

Dropping a column from the table

Key Concepts Covered:

SQL data types

PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL constraints

INSERT statements and constraint validation

ALTER TABLE commands

Importance of constraints in database design

Tools Used:

MySQL Workbench

Status:
Task completed successfully. All queries were executed and verified as per the task requirements.
