🛒 Online Retail Sales Database Design

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a normalized relational database (3NF) for an online retail (e-commerce) platform using MySQL / PostgreSQL.

The database manages customers, products, categories, orders, order items, and payments. It also includes analytical SQL queries using JOIN operations to generate meaningful sales reports.

⸻

🎯 Objective • Design a structured and normalized database schema. • Create an ER diagram. • Implement tables with proper constraints. • Insert sample data. • Generate sales reports using JOIN queries. • Create SQL views for reporting.

⸻

🛠 Tools Used • MySQL / PostgreSQL • dbdiagram.io (for ER diagram design) • SQL (DDL, DML, JOINs, Views)

⸻

🧱 Database Design

📊 Entities

The database consists of the following entities: 1. Customers 2. Categories 3. Products 4. Orders 5. Order_Items 6. Payments

⸻

🔗 Relationships • One Customer → Many Orders • One Order → Many Order Items • One Product → Many Order Items • One Category → Many Products • One Order → One Payment

⸻

🧠 Normalization

The schema is normalized up to Third Normal Form (3NF):

✅ First Normal Form (1NF) • Atomic values • No repeating groups

✅ Second Normal Form (2NF) • No partial dependencies • Many-to-many relationships resolved using order_items

✅ Third Normal Form (3NF) • No transitive dependencies • Category details separated from products • Customer details separated from orders

🗂 Project Structure online-retail-sales-db/ │ ├── ER_Diagram.png ├── schema.sql ├── sample_data.sql ├── queries.sql └── README.md

🏗 Database Schema Features • Primary Keys • Foreign Keys • UNIQUE constraints • CHECK constraints • DEFAULT values • AUTO_INCREMENT IDs • Proper referential integrity

⸻

📦 Sample Data

The project includes sample data for: • Multiple customers • Multiple product categories • Products with pricing and stock • Orders with multiple items • Payments with status tracking

⸻

📊 Sales Reports (JOIN Queries)

The following reports are implemented: • Customer Order Report • Detailed Order Breakdown • Product Sales Report • Revenue by Product • Revenue by Category • Payment Status Report • Top Spending Customers

These queries demonstrate: • INNER JOIN • GROUP BY • Aggregate functions (SUM) • Calculated fields • ORDER BY • Business-level reporting

⸻

📈 View Created

sales_summary

A SQL view that provides: • Order ID • Customer Name • Total Sales per Order

This simplifies analytical reporting.

⸻

🚀 How to Run This Project 1. Create a new database: CREATE DATABASE online_retail; USE online_retail;

Run: • schema.sql • sample_data.sql • queries.sql 3. Execute queries to generate reports.

💡 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned: • Database schema design • ER diagram modeling • Database normalization (3NF) • Writing DDL & DML scripts • Implementing constraints • Writing complex JOIN queries • Generating business reports using SQL

⸻

📌 Future Improvements • Add indexes for performance optimization • Implement stored procedures • Add triggers for stock updates after orders • Add monthly sales analytics • Build a backend API on top of this database
