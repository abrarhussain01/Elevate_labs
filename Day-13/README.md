# Task 13: Transactions & ACID Properties

## Objective
To understand SQL transactions and ACID properties using a banking system example.

## Concepts Covered
- START TRANSACTION
- COMMIT
- ROLLBACK
- SAVEPOINT
- Isolation Levels
- Dirty Read Prevention
- Concurrent Updates

## Description
A bank database was created with an accounts table. 
Transactions were used to transfer money between accounts. 
Failure scenarios were simulated to demonstrate rollback and atomicity. 
Isolation levels were tested using two sessions to prevent dirty reads.

## Outcome
Learned how transactions maintain data consistency and reliability in databases.
